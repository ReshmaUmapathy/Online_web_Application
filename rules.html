<h1>INSTRUCTIONS:</h1>

<h1>Step 1.</h1>Check Your Browser Options before the Test to ensure that it is not set to disconnect after several minutes of inactivity.<br>

* The location of this setting depends on your browser. For example, in Internet Explorer 5, 6, 7 & 8 it is located under Tools>Internet Options><br>
Connections>Settings>Advanced<br>
* If you have an Internet Service Provider that will break your connection if you don.t visit a new site after a certain period of time, then keep another<br>
window open and occasionally visit it and load a new page or refresh the page to keep your connection open.<br>

<h1>Step 2.</h1>Do Not Use the "Back" Button on Your Browser During the Test once you have begun taking the quiz. Instead, use the scroll bar to move back to check<br>
 earlier questions.<br>
Don't close the window of the test for any reason.<br>

If something goes wrong, send an e-mail to your professor immediately, documenting the exact problem and asking how you should proceed. Include your username<br>
 and the course and section number.<br>

<h1>Step 3.</h1> Review All of Your Answers Before Submitting the Quiz. Make sure you have not accidentally changed your response to a question or made a typographic mistake.<br>

<h1>Step 4.</h1>When you are satisfied with the result make sure you finish by clicking the SUBMIT button at the bottom of the screen. Click the Submit Button ONLY ONCE!<br>
After you submit the test answers, you will receive a score unless you have exceeded the time limit for the quiz.<br>
